# TwitterGender
This repository includes several machine-learning algorithms for determining whether a particular tweet was written by a company, female, or male. Using the tweet's text content, along with metadata such as the user's sidebar and link colors, the user's username and description, and the number of retweets and favorites the tweet received, we attempt to determine the gender of the tweet's author.
